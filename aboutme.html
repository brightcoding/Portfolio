      <h3> Girls Who Code </h3>
      <p> Stephanie Walcott </p> 
      <ul>
        <h1> Biography </h1> 
        <li> I am extremely inquisitive person. </li> 
        <li> I question the existence of things and how those things came to be. And most importantly WHY, why they came to be. </li> 
        <li> I began this program with the goal of becoming an experienced coder, in order to supply an app, website, program, or etc. that affects society on a global scale in hopes of creating necessary change.</li>
        <p> With the knowledge I gain over the course of this program and as I continue to further my education in computer science I plan to produce apps, programs, websites, and etc. that directly benefit the environment,progressive activism, and creativity. 
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <h1> Occupation </h1>
        <li> Student  </li>
      </ul> 
      <ul> 
        <h1> Computer Science and Robotics Skills: </h1> 
        <li> Computer Scientist </li>
        </ul>
          
      <ul>
        <h1> What I learned! </h1>
        <li> I learned how to create a webpage by coding in the html language.</li>
        <li> As we discussed ethics in regards to Robotics it challenged my thinking. Who is accountable for errors? The machine or the programmer? 
          Are humans going to become dangerously lazy? Is everybody going to have access to the same technology? Or will it be exclusive? <li> 
      </ul
