  <p>Edge is a website created by Heying Zhang and Stephanie Walcott to enhance the relationship between humans and the environment that surrounds them.
It is named 'edge' because the world is on the EDGE of an apocalyptic world if we do not take a step as humans and protect our home. Not only, to protect future
generations, but also because Earth is not only home to humans, but to mammals, insects, and millions of other life forms that we must co-exist with.
The Earth, our home, is being diminished because of negative human impact on the environment. Anthropogenic impact on the environment has been nothing but negative.
These Girls Who Code alumna, wanted any body that cares about the environment to visit the website and educate themselves on what they can do to contribute to the Earth.
And also provide a platform for environmental organizations or anybody to post about new projects for proactive people to become involved in. </p>
